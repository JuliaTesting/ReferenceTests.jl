By default it is isequal if not explicitly stated.\nformat: Force reading the file using a specific format\n\nTypes\n\nThe file-extension of filename, as well as the type of the result of evaluating expr, determine how contents are processed and compared. The contents is treated as:\n\nImages when expr is an image type, i.e., AbstractArray{<:Colorant};\nSHA256 when filename endswith *.sha256;\nAny file-type which FileIO.jl handles and with the proper backend loaded;\nText as a fallback.\n\nAny FileIO.jl handled filetype\n\nAny file-types which can be read by FileIO.jl can be used. Note that most Julia values can be stored using packages such as, e.g., BSON.jl or JLD and can thus be used in reference-tests.\n\nImages\n\nImages are compared approximately using a different by to ignore most encoding and decoding errors. The default function is generated from psnr_equality.\n\nThe file can be either common image files (e.g., *.png), which are handled by FileIO, or text-coded *.txt files, which is handled by ImageInTerminal. Text-coded image has less storage requirements and also allows to view the reference file in a simple terminal using cat.\n\nSHA256\n\nThe hash of the expr and content of filename are compared.\n\ntip: Tip\nThis is useful for a convenient low-storage way of making sure that the return value doesn't change for selected test cases.\n\nFallback\n\nSimply test the equality of expr and the contents of filename without any preprocessing. Note that reading filename will return a String.\n\nExamples\n\n# compare text-file against string representation of a value\n@test_reference \"stringtest1.txt\" collect(1:20)\n\n# test number with absolute tolerance 10\n@test_reference \"references/string3.txt\" 1338 by=(ref, x)->isapprox(ref, x; atol=10)\n\n# store a floating point array ar in BSON-file and compare it back.\n# Note that a Dict is needed and the custom comparison function.\nusing BSON\ncomp(d1, d2) = keys(d1)==keys(d2) &&\n    all([ v1â‰ˆv2 for (v1,v2) in zip(values(d1), values(d2))])\n@test_reference \"reftest-files/X.bson\" Dict(:ar=>[1, pi, 4.5]) by=comp\n\n# store as string using ImageInTerminal with encoding size (5,10)\nusing TestImages\n@test_reference \"camera.txt\" testimage(\"cameraman\") size=(5,10)\n\n# using folders in the relative path is allowed\n@test_reference \"references/camera.png\" testimage(\"cameraman\")\n\n# Images can also be stored as hash.
